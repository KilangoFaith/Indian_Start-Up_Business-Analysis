# Indian_Start-Up_Business-Analysis
The aim of the project is to explore Indian start-up ecosystem shared data, investigate the ecosystem and propose the best course of action.


## Introduction
Ideas, creativity, and execution are essential for a start-up to flourish. But are they enough? Investors provide start-ups and other entrepreneurial ventures with the capital---popularly known as "funding"---to think big, grow rich, and leave a lasting impact. In this project, I am going to analyse funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021.


### Details
The data for each year of funding is in a separate csv file in the dataset provided. In these files there is the start-ups' details, the funding amounts received, and the investors' information.

**The  following are the column names and description**

Company/Brand: Name of the company/start-up

Founded: Year start-up was founded

Sector: Sector of service

What it does: Description about Company

Founders: Founders of the Company

Investor: Investors

Amount($): Raised fund

Stage: Round of funding reached

The objective is to develop a unique story from this dataset by stating and testing a hypothesis, asking questions, performing analysis and share insights with appropriate visualisations.

**so the steps will entail the following**

Ask questions

Develop hypothesis

Visualise the data

Compiling the insights in a blog post and sharing the analysis on Medium, LinkedIn, Dev.to, personal blog or a suitable blogging website.
